	<p><h3 style="background: violet; color: white">A journey they said begins with a step.Patience they said is a virtue.Its been evrything some in this one year lol buh we are grateful we are here and still moving foward. I never thought this day would come for me to celebrate you and celebrate with you,youve been an annoying boyfriend,no doubt buh i love evrybit of you.Youve grown soo much and im really happy to see you grown.Fights,quarrels,happiness,joy,anger,moodiness etc are all part of a relationship,its not always sweet buh to stay through it all determines how much you want your partner.There is no perfect partner on earth,if you want someone,take him,make perfect out of his inperfections,and you are an awesome example.12 months of being in this relationship and it feels like forever.i wouldnt wait for a second to say i do.You are just amazing,I thank you sooo much this day and i celebrate you for your patience with me and how tough youve made me.Youve always been with me through it all and im sooo grateful.All i pray for is that,whatever we have doesnt end and should not minimize but to grown more and more.i love you soo much babe.HAPPY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY</h3></p>
